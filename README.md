# MCTS-Rust
This is a Monte-Carlo Tree Search alghorithm written in Rust. It includes some unit tests that use the algorithm to play tic-tac-toe. It should never lose since the game is simple enough to be completely solved.

I have tested this algorithm in playing Mancala, also known as Congklak. It has never lost to a human player. Feel free to compile and run.

Switch to the ``/mancala`` folder, then
```
cargo run --release
```
